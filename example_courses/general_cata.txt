8A 2-wire Connector
• Ov erview: 8A copper cable splice crimp
connector efficiently splices telephone cable
conductors without stripping insulation.
• Capacity: 2-wire connector. Accommodates
conductors from 0.4mm to 0.9mm. This single-
wire (discrete) connector can be used to splice
two wires.
• Operation: Polypropylene plastic parts are
resistant to fungi, heat, solvents and stress-
cracking agents and compatible with metals
and other materials used in cable
manufacturing, such as conductor insulation
and filling compounds.
• All metal components are resistant to or
protected against general and localised
corrosion, including stress corrosion cracking
and pitting.
• Gel-filling gives excellent environmental
protection. It will not produce galvanic corrosion
effects on other metals present, even in wet or
humid conditions.
• Packing Information: Supplied in a box of 500.
• Features & Benefits: Compact – ideal for cable
splicing within small closures and housings
• Durable – excellent environmental protection
from moisture and contamination
• Versatile – available in multiple configurations
(gel-filled, no gel, colour-coded, and more).
• Application: Cable Splicing - Ideal for
applications involving aerial, buried and
underground construction, which are exposed to
various temperatures, humidity, pollutants and
craftsman-applied chemicals.
8A 3-wire Connector
• Operation: Ideally suited for all types of cable
splicing, requiring only simple tools and providing
a small splice bundle. Designed to endure harsh
climate conditions, the 8B uses a single crimp to
displace the insulation and provide a cold-solder
connection, which delivers low contact resistance.
• Packing Information: Supplied in a box of 250.
• Capacity: 3-wire connector.
• M aterial: Polypropylene, colour-coded covers for
easy identification. Various versions are available.

8C Half Tap Connector
• Operation: Gel-filled polypropylene half-tap
connector. Wires are pushed inside the portholes
of the connector. Manual pre-crimping with an
approved tool is required prior to crimping to
ensure a reliable connection.
• Packing Information: Supplied in a box of 250.
• Capacity: 2 wire connector. Designed for
conductors from 0.4 mm to 0.9 mm in diameter,
with a maximum 2.08 diameter insulation.

11A Make-before-break Connector
• Operation: The 11A is used on working pairs to cut
out connectors previously in circuit, and a pre-
crimp facility lets the connector be held in
position prior to crimping.
• Two entry ports allow conductors to pass both
through the connector and in from the sides,
giving greater flexibility in application.
• Uses U-type insulation displacement connectors
(IDCs) and an integral cut-off blade to form a
connection between two insulated conductors.
• Capacity: 2 wire connector. Designed for
conductors from 0.4 mm to 0.9 mm in diameter,
with a maximum 2.08 diameter insulation.
• M aterial: Polypropylene colour-coded covers for
easy identification and various versions available.
Gel-filled.
• Packing Information: Supplied in box of 500.
• Features & Benefits: Make-before-break - Once
the connector is crimped, electrical contact
through the contact elements occurs prior to
wire cut-off and any excess conductor length is
cut off, leaving an easily accessed and sealable
test point.
• Compact
• Easy to use
• Application: Cable Splicing

Glue / Adhesive Cable Fixing
DexGreen Glue dispensing tool allows for the
controlled application of adhesives.
Cartridges attach to the tool using wide
flanges ensuring that the cartridge is secure
inside the dispenser even under constant
pressure, the force applied to the cartridge
gives an even and reliable flow of adhesive.
The dispenser allows for a quick change of
cartridges.
Cable Wall Entry Cover
A considerate fibre routing kit designed to
be rapidly and discretely installed. Our wall
mounted solution is ideal for retro-fitting or
in-the-home routing.
Cabling Tool
To aid the transition of cables between both
internal and external wall, Dexgreen
manufactures two options of a wall insertion
tool to suit any install practice.
The SC-APC connector is clipped onto the
rear of the assembly and pulled through the
wall via a 300mm rod.
SC-APC clips into the rear of the tool. Pulling
the connector through can ensure that any
debris or rubble is cleared before the
connector and cable are pulled over it.

900µm 1f Discrete Drop
900um round profile drop cable with
coloured primary coating.
Cable is compatible with our DexTidy system
for visually discrete deployment of wall
mounted fibre .
Pushable 2x3mm Drop
Figure-8 profile cable with 900um module in
centre.
2x strength members help support the cable
across longer spans and make for easy
tearing of outer jacket for connections.
3.0mm Pushable Drop Cable
The 3mm Drop Cable is suitable for
installation with multiple clamps, for
example; spiral wraps and mandrel clamps
with excellent performance. Tested under a
range of environmental conditions and PIA-
approved. The cable can be tailored to the
requirements of multiple operators for
example jacket colour, connectivity
requirements (i.e. LC/APC, etc).

COPPER 10. XCSL POTS SPLITTER
The new Dexgreen PCP Splitter System has been designed to be installed in the PCP rather than the DSLAM. Only
one tie cable is required between the PCP and the DSLAM. The splitter block fitted in the PCP has the same
electrical performance characteristics as the splitters currently fitted in the DSLAM. The Dexgreen Splitter block
will comply to the same operating conditions as met by our existing PCP Tool Less Connector System.
