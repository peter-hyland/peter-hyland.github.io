innovative Dexbond product, a joint closure
sealant that saved our clients millions in
engineer callouts and overall fault volume
reduction.
Today, DexGreen develops innovative and
tailor-made products to upgrade carrier
networks across the world.
We manufacture over 200 unique products
while also offering ongoing support through
our mobile app. We utilise the latest in AR and
AI technology to provide you with a digital
installation assistant that reduces revisit costs
significantly, along with a mobile learning

SUSTAINABILITY
DexGreen is accredited to BS EN ISO9001:2015 quality
standard and BS EN ISO14001:2015 environmental
standard. Our scope of approval covers design,
manufacture and distribution of products and services to
the telecommunications, pharmaceutical and process
industries.
ISO 14001 is the international standard that specifies
requirements for an effective Environmental
Management System (EMS).
There are many benefits to ISO 14001:2015, including
improving resource efficiency, waste reduction, assuring
that environmental impact is being measured and
improving overall environmental impact.
Approximately 50 pages of installation guides covering
all cable types are required for the CSP demarcation box
alone. An installation book would usually be included,
however, by utilizing videos and app-based digital
documentation, we have significantly reduced our paper
usage.
DexGreen is committed to reducing the use of single-use
plastics in our packaging. Plastic bags have been
removed from our discrete connector range, resulting in
the removal of 150,000 bags per year.
In other product ranges, we prevent over 13 Tonnes of
single-use plastic wastage yearly. This is done by
replacing the plastic with more environmentally friendly,
compostable materials.
By increasing recycling at DexGreen headquarters, we
have seen a reduction in waste going to landfill. We have
implemented initiatives to reduce energy and water
usage and reduced air travel by supplementing site visits
with alternative methods of communication, such as
Teleconferencing.

bend radii around corners and bends across
our cable range (0.9mm, 2mm, 2.9mm). The
discrete nature of the bend managers allows
for them to blend in with the setting while
providing optimal safety and retention
Nano Cable Clips

• Dimension – 160mm x 55mm
Glue / Adhesive Cable Fixing
DexGreen Glue dispensing tool allows for the
controlled application of adhesives.
Cartridges attach to the tool using wide
flanges ensuring that the cartridge is secure
inside the dispenser even under constant
pressure, the force applied to the cartridge
gives an even and reliable flow of adhesive.
The dispenser allows for a quick change of
cartridges.
Cable Wall Entry Cover
A considerate fibre routing kit designed to
be rapidly and discretely installed. Our wall
mounted solution is ideal for retro-fitting or
in-the-home routing.
Cabling Tool
To aid the transition of cables between both
internal and external wall, Dexgreen
manufactures two options of a wall insertion
tool to suit any install practice.
The SC-APC connector is clipped onto the
rear of the assembly and pulled through the
wall via a 300mm rod.
SC-APC clips into the rear of the tool. Pulling
the connector through can ensure that any
debris or rubble is cleared before the
connector and cable are pulled over it.
Discrete 2.0mm (1 - 12f) Cable
Surface-mounted fiber cable for distribution
or feeder use with extractable 250µm
primary coated fibers. Suitable for internal
wall or riser installations with proper
conduit/sub-duct for mechanical protection.
Available in G657A2 or G657B3 fiber types,
both bending insensitive.
