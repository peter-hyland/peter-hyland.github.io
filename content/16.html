<h1> The Future of python and AI <h1>In the world of code, a concept profound<br/>
Is recursion, a loop that goes round and round<br/>
A function that calls itself, again and again<br/>
To solve problems complex, with logic to gain<br/>
<br/>
Like a mirror reflecting its own reflection<br/>
Recursion dives deep into its own inception<br/>
Breaking down tasks into smaller parts<br/>
Until the solution is found, in multiple starts<br/>
<br/>
A base case to stop the infinite loop<br/>
Ensures the program won't go out of the group<br/>
With each iteration, progress is made<br/>
Until the final result is ultimately displayed<br/>
<br/>
So remember, in programming's grand design<br/>
Recursion is a tool that can truly shine<br/>
Solving problems with elegance and grace<br/>
In a never-ending loop, it finds its place.</body>
